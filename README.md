For our project we had two tasks.

1. Group articles based on the words that appear in their titles into a predefined number of topics.
2. Predict user engagement with news articles. Specifically the number of clicks an article receives.

Our team utilized the MIND, or Microsoft News Dataset, that was released in 2020.
