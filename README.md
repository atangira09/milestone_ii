For our project our team had two tasks.

1. Group articles based on the words that appear in their titles into a predefined number of topics.
2. Predict user engagement with news articles. Specifically the number of clicks an article receives.

Our team utilized the MIND, or Microsoft News Dataset, that was released in 2020.

The MIND dataset consists of multiple data assets: behaviors.tsv and news.tsv.

The behaviors.tsv contains impression logs, user history, and the columns described below.

- Impression ID; a unique identifier for the impression instance,
- User ID; an anonymized identifier for each user,
- Time; or timestamp of the impression,
- History; or the list of news article IDs clicked by the user before the current impression, and
- Impressions; or the list of news presented in the impression with a label for each indicating whether it was clicked or not.
